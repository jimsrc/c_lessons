## LESSONS FROM C & C++

- **templates**: use of templates with linked objects :smiley:

Use:
```
cd templates
make clean && make
```

- **exceptions**: use of try/catch :trollface:

- **backward-cpp**: reports stack trace (it woulb nice to report the line sentence of *every* call chain) :squirrel:

> _A general rule of thumb is that your program spends 80% of its time running 20% of the code. Thus a good strategy for efficient coding is to write everything, profile your code, and optimize the parts that need it. Python’s profilers are great, and Cython allows you to do the latter step with minimal effort._ - Hoyt Koepke
