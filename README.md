> _A general rule of thumb is that your program spends 80% of its time running 20% of the code. Thus a good strategy for efficient coding is to write everything, profile your code, and optimize the parts that need it. Pythonâ€™s profilers are great, and Cython allows you to do the latter step with minimal effort._ - Hoyt Koepke
