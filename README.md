## LESSONS FROM C & C++

- _templates_: use of templates with linked objects :smiley: /play yeah
Use:
```
cd templates
make clean && make
```

- _exceptions_: use of try/catch :trollface:

> *A general rule of thumb is that your program spends 80% of its time running 20% of the code. Thus a good strategy for efficient coding is to write everything, profile your code, and optimize the parts that need it. Pythonâ€™s profilers are great, and Cython allows you to do the latter step with minimal effort.* - Hoyt Koepke
